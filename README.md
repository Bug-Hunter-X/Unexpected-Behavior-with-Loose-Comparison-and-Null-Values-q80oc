# JavaScript Bug: Loose Comparison and Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose comparison (==) and the handling of null or undefined values.  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected results when comparing against null or undefined, potentially causing logic errors in your code.

The `bug.js` file contains code that exhibits this issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, explicitly handling null values to prevent the unexpected behavior.
